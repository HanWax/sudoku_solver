SuDoku Solver
=============

Objectives
-----------
* To write a programme that can solve a SuDoku programme using Ruby 

Requirements
------------
* The goal of the game is to fill out the entire grid with numbers. 
* The trick is that every row, every column and every box must have all nine digits 1 to 9. 
* That is, if row 1 in this example already has digits 8 and 9, they can't be used in the same row anymore

Technological Configuration
---------------------------
* Ruby
* RSpec

Next steps
----------
* To implement a solution for a hard SuDoku puzzle, where there is no unique solution for any of the unsolved cells
